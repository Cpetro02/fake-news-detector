# Fake News Detector

## Introduction
### Problem Statement
Fake news has existed for hundreds of centuries but has exacerbated in impact by the ability to quickly and easily spread information across the internet. 
False information can manipulate public opinion and behaviors for political, financial, or social gain.
It is often indistinguishable from real news sources by non-trained, everyday individuals.
### Proposed Solution
In order to tackle the copious quantities of fake news across the internet today, it is necessary to develop automated models that can detect and flag them.
This will protect people from misinformation and radicalism, empowering them to make informed decisions.
